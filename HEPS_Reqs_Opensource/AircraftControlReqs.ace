Requirement AircraftControl_1:
	Aircraft_Control shall set aircraft_control_reference_of_throttle to 100.5 // this value should be set by pilot
	when aircraft_control_input_control is equal to Cockpit_Controls.
	
Requirement AircraftControl_2:
	Aircraft_Control shall set aircraft_control_reference_of_throttle to 30.6 // this value should be set by auto-pilot
	when aircraft_control_input_control is equal to Automated_Control.

Requirement AircraftControl_3:
	Aircraft_Control shall set aircraft_control_turbine_drive_train to ON
	when aircraft_control_reference_of_throttle > 0.0.
	
Requirement AircraftControl_4:
	Aircraft_Control shall set aircraft_control_fuel_flow_reference to 1000.1 // should be max_fuel_flow, which is declared as a real constant
	when aircraft_control_reference_of_throttle > max_fuel_flow.

Requirement AircraftControl_5:
	Aircraft_Control shall set aircraft_control_electric_drive_train to ON 
	when aircraft_control_reference_of_throttle > max_fuel_flow and aircraft_control_mode_of_operation = Takeoff. //TODO: Check if this Aircraft:aircraft_mode_of_operation
	
Requirement AircraftControl_6:
	Aircraft_Control shall set aircraft_control_electric_drive_train to OFF 
	when aircraft_control_Fault_DCAC_DCACcontroller > 1.0 or aircraft_control_Fault_DCDC_DCDCcontroller = 1.0.
